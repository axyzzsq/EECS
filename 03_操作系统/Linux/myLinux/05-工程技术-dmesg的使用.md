# dmesg Cmd Usage

## 1、Troubleshooting

```shell
dmesg | grep -i error
```

This command will display only the error messages in the kernel log, regardless of their case.

## 2、Debugging

```shell
dmesg | grep -i my_module
```

This command will display only the kernel log messages generated by the `my_module` kernel module, regardless of their case.



## 3、Monitoring

```shell
dmesg | grep -i hardware
```

This command will display only the kernel log messages related to hardware events, regardless of their case.



## 4、Clearing the kernel ring buffer

```shell
sudo dmesg -c
```

This will clear the kernel log and remove all existing messages. This can be useful if you want to start fresh and only view messages generated after a specific event or time.



## 5、Displaying messages in real-time

```shell
sudo dmesg -w
```

This will display kernel messages in real-time, similar to running the `tail` command on a log file.

 

## 6、Saving the kernel log to a file

```shell
sudo dmesg -T > kernel_log.txt
```

This will save the kernel log to a file called `kernel_log.txt`, with each message preceded by a timestamp indicating when it was generated.



## Example

```shell
dmesg | grep -i 'memory\|cpu\|hardware\|firmware'
```

The command `dmesg` displays the kernel ring buffer, which contains system messages and information generated during the boot process and other system events.

The `|` character (pipe) is a shell operator that redirects the output of the `dmesg` command to the input of the `grep` command.

The `grep` command searches for lines in the input that match the given pattern. In this case, the `-i` option makes the search case-insensitive, and the `'memory\|cpu\|hardware\|firmware'` pattern matches lines that contain any of the specified words (separated by the `|` character), such as:

- `Initializing cgroup subsys memory`
- `Initializing CPU#0`
- `Detected 8 CPUs`
- `Using firmware framebuffer frame buffer device`
- `ACPI: RSDP 00000000000f0470 00024 (v02 DELL )`
- `ACPI: XSDT 00000000af7e2180 0007C (v01 DELL PE_SC3 00000001 ASL 00000061)`

So, the overall effect of the command `dmesg | grep -i 'memory\|cpu\|hardware\|firmware'` is to display system information related to memory, CPU, hardware, and firmware that were generated during the boot process and recorded in the kernel ring buffer. This can be useful for troubleshooting system issues or getting an overview of the system hardware and configuration.
