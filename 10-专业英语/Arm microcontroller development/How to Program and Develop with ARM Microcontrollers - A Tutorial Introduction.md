this is the first in an ongoing series on the arm microcontroller how to program the microcontroller and the circuit building associated with this controller this will be a series very similar to the AVR series that you can find on newbie hakam I will be demonstrating many different types of circuits control communication and sensing using the arm m0 through the latest M series that is available at the time of the video creation for those of you that may not know what a microcontroller is or what it does a microcontroller can do what its name implies control but it can also sense receive input respond to events and communicate to other devices and peripherals such as external computers other microcontrollers or other devices that have integrated circuitry that enables it to communicate the way that microcontrollers can sense is they can receive analog input from a sensor and have that input converted into a digital format enabling the microcontroller to sense things such as temperature light flexibility pressure angular velocity tilt gravity movement and many other types of sensing mark controllers can also communicate with other devices and computers using serial communication such as I squared C spi and UART for you sort and all of these types of communication can enable wireless communication like Wi-Fi Bluetooth and radio frequency microcontrollers can also receive digital input not related to serial communication such as button presses encoder encoder pulses PWM signals and any other type of on and off signal coming in to the microcontroller the type of instruction I like to give is based on the lowest level fundamentals with circuit building which means using the single processor and building off of that not using a platform like the Arduino discovery board or Raspberry Pi learning in this more fundamental way will engender better foundational knowledge on how to design efficiently and prototype for large production if you start with the platform that already has a large buildup of circuitry once you embark on making a real design for production you need to take steps backwards to get to an efficient prototype keep arduino z' and other interface platforms - one-off projects and learn the fundamentals if you want to get into design that is efficient and cost-effective in this series the programming language used will be C++ and in most cases I will create the libraries and functions rather than using existing libraries since the microcontroller is a surface mount device we can't just plug this into a breadboard we need a way to get the pins into a breadboard we will be using this card and interface the card simply contains the arm microcontroller and spreads the legs into traces that have headers that go into the breadboard a card was designed to specifically use three breadboards one for each of the sides of the card the configuration works well since there are many tie script connections for each pin and there is a break between the breadboard to add a resistor or other component to another tie strip for instance a resistor can be placed here and the LED can be placed here which is more visually coherent than facing components in a zigzag on neighboring strips I hope you will follow along in the series with me to learn about the ARM architecture and convected programming and circuit building thank you for watching

这是关于 arm 微控制器的持续系列中的第一个如何对微控制器和与该控制器相关的电路构建进行编程这将是一个非常类似于 AVR 系列的系列，您可以在新手 hakam 上找到我将演示许多不同的类型 电路控制通信和传感使用 arm m0 到最新的 M 系列，在视频创建时可供那些可能不知道微控制器是什么或它做什么的人使用 微控制器可以实现其名称所暗示的控制 但它也可以感知接收输入响应事件并与其他设备和外围设备通信，例如外部计算机、其他微控制器或其他具有集成电路的设备，使其能够以微控制器可以感知的方式进行通信，即它们可以从传感器接收模拟输入 并将该输入转换为数字格式，使微控制器能够感测诸如温度之类的东西 光柔性压力角速度倾斜重力运动和许多其他类型的传感标记控制器也可以使用串行通信与其他设备和计算机通信，例如 I squared C spi 和 UART 为您排序，所有这些类型的通信都可以实现无线通信，如 Wi-Fi 蓝牙和射频微控制器也可以接收与串行通信无关的数字输入，例如按钮按下编码器编码器脉冲 PWM 信号和任何其他类型的进入微控制器的开和关信号我喜欢给出的指令类型是 基于电路构建的最低级别基础知识，这意味着使用单个处理器并以此为基础构建而不使用像 Arduino 发现板或 Raspberry Pi 这样的平台 对于大型生产，如果您从已经存在的平台开始 一旦您开始为生产进行真正的设计，就会有大量的电路堆积，您需要向后退一步以获得高效的原型保持 arduino z' 和其他接口平台 - 一次性项目并学习基础知识，如果你想获得 进入本系列中高效且具有成本效益的设计中，使用的编程语言将是 C++，在大多数情况下，我将创建库和函数，而不是使用现有库，因为微控制器是表面贴装设备，我们不能直接插入它 进入面包板 我们需要一种方法将引脚插入面包板 我们将使用这张卡和接口 该卡只包含 arm 微控制器并将支腿展开成带有进入面包板的接头的迹线 卡专门设计用于 三个面包板一个用于卡的每一侧配置工作良好，因为每个引脚都有许多 tie 脚本连接并且 breadb 之间有一个中断 将电阻器或其他组件添加到另一个连接带的板，例如，可以将电阻器放置在这里，并且可以将 LED 放置在这里，这比在相邻条带上以锯齿形面对组件在视觉上更连贯我希望你能跟随这个系列 和我一起学习ARM架构和对流编程电路搭建谢谢观看
